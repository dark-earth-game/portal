Welcome to the Dark Earth Game Portal.

This community driven project aims as a goto resource for all things Dark Earth and to detail a reimplementation of the PC version of the game, developed by Kalisto Entertainment in 1997. The idea is to reimplement the game in C programing language and document any findings about the technical details of the game.

While documenting the game we want to teach how Kalisto Entertainment implemented Dark Earth game and create technical specifications about the process.
