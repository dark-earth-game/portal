    "content": "Dark Earth is a world that is both sombre and epic, mediaeval and technological, realistic and imaginary, which behind a “rational” facade hides mysteries and dangers that surpass human understanding. Dark Earth will enable the player (and us, its designers) to explore a vast range of themes, places, actions and intrigues. Encounters and exchanges with other characters, epic combats between horrible creatures, discovering fantastic places and wondrous powers, reflecting on religion, legends, the future, and the origins of Mankind… . “… The tiny group finally managed to struggle to the top of the ridge of black dust. Hulvar was the first to stop. Pulling back the heavy hood that hid his face, he let out a sigh of relief. As he turned to his two companions, his scarred face broke out into one of his rare smiles. “There!” he said, pointing to the plain that was now visible below. In spite of her wounds, Ylanna’s face lit up. “The Stallite Dohymion!” she said in wonder, “we are back on the right path!” Behind her, old Ketoun was silent, but tears of joy rolled down his deeply wrinkled cheeks. For several minutes they stood, contemplating the sacred light of the Sun God piercing the layers of the Black Shroud, feasting their eyes on the dazzling walls of Dohymion. Suddenly, wild, inhuman cries echoed once more through the wastelands behind them. Hulvar grabbed Ylanna’s hand and they ran towards the City of Light… “ . Dark Earth is our Earth, three centuries in the future. But far from being the happy, glowing future we might hope for, this is a ravaged, icy, merciless world. The days are perpetual twilight while the nights are shrouded in utter darkness. At the start of the third millennium, a gigantic comet passed very close to Earth, spitting out hundreds of deadly meteorites that neither anyone nor anything on the planet was able to stop. The resulting cataclysm changed the face of the earth forever. The sky became a dome of black dust, the cold air is thick and clings to the lungs before crystallizing on your cracked lips as you breathe out. There is a permanent murky smog, with visibility hardly ever exceeding five hundred yards. Nobody ventures alone into the desolate landscape of Dark Earth. Death lurks everywhere. The treacherous ground gives way beneath careless feet, invisible poison clouds drift through the air, and the deathly cold of the night can paralyse even the strongest. And then there are the creatures, the ‘things’ that creep and crawl soundlessly through the night into the rash traveller’s camp; the foolhardy voyager will never again see the half-light of day… . And yet in this nightmare world, a few islands of hope and civilization still cling on to life. These are the Stallites, fortified cities built by the survivors of the cataclysm. These places of refuge, warmth, and safety are blessed and protected by the Sun God. The Stallites are illuminated by miraculous shafts of light that rend the black veil of the sky. The people of the Stallites are united by the same religious fervour, the worship of the Sun God. Here they have been able to relearn how day follows night. They search their memories to try to understand and use the strange devices left over from pre-Cataclysm days. And most importantly, they learn how to control, conserve and radiate sunlight in order to protect themselves from the all-embracing darkness. On Dark Earth, light is the most precious commodity there is. Although the sombre story of the hail of fire and black rock that rained down on the planet has been handed down through legend, the inhabitants of Dark Earth are unaware of the real causes of the cataclysm. Many believe the catastrophe to be an ancient curse, a divine punishment. Only a very few know the Truth. The future of the planet is in the hands of Man, a fragile, ephemeral creature caught between two duelling forces that are beyond his understanding. ",

    "content": "“… This is Troy McLurr for CNN World News. At the minute I’m in Louisville, Arizona, right in the middle of a high-risk area. The latest from the scientists is that the whole country will be bombarded by meteorites if - God forbid - Operation Guardian Angels proves unsuccessful. Everybody here is going through an extremely tense time right now, me included. Lots of people are watching the skies, waiting for the first sign of the comet that some are calling the ‘Black Moon’ or even ‘the Wrath of God’. The rest have already made their decision and have fled to supposedly less exposed areas…” . On December 6th, 2054, Professor Erataux of the Institute of Stellar Studies, high up in the French Pyrenees, saw a huge unknown celestial body appear in the sight of his telescope: a comet which had previously been masked by the sun and was heading towards the heart of our solar system. The Professor quickly informed his colleagues around the world of his discovery. On December 8th, twelve of the world’s greatest astronomers held a hastily convened meeting at the International Calculation Center in New York to compare their calculations and voice their concerns about the path of Erataux’ comet. The ICC’s computers soon confirmed what the astronomers already suspected: the comet would pass less than 40,000 kilometres away from Earth on December 23rd. At that distance, it seemed inevitable that pieces of the comet would crash to Earth. A particularly unwelcome Christmas present! . On December 10th, the heads of state of over thirty nations made their way quietly to Geneva for a top secret meeting. The only information that filtered through suggested that they were debating a new plan to maintain world peace. On December 12th, the “Guardian Angels” plan was launched. This involved equipping thirteen of the space stations and satellites in orbit around the Earth with long-range nuclear weapons. The aim of these Space Guardians would be to destroy or divert any detritus resulting from the passage of Erataux’ comet. Several space shuttles with weapons and technicians on board were sent up to the space stations. Each Guardian Angel would be equipped with ten gigantic Thunderstrike stratospheric nuclear missiles. In order to calm public opinion, an official communiqué was released, describing the launches as scientific or maintenance missions. But on December 15th, the World Times leaked the truth about Operation Guardian Angels and the grave dangers of the comet skimming by so close to Earth. The whole media machine took up the story, and the announcement of the comet’s arrival provoked an unprecedented wave of panic all over the world. The crime and suicide rates soared everywhere, and people flocked to churches, mosques, synagogues, and temples of every kind. Forced to recognize the danger, the heads of state did all in their power to reassure their own people and quieten their fears, assuring them that the Guardian Angels plan would be a complete success. In some countries, however, martial law was declared in order to maintain a semblance of calm. All over the world, men and women scanned the skies with terror-stricken eyes. The first meteors were spotted on December 20th, automatically triggering the launch of thirteen missiles. Unfortunately, the speed with which some of the defence systems had been installed caused serious malfunctions. One of the missiles exploded on the launch pad, completely destroying the Chinese Kwan II space station, while others went off course and were lost in space. In any case, it was too late… Despite all Man’s efforts, the sons of the Black Moon hurtled towards Earth, destroying the missiles that flew into its path like moths into a flame. Some of the meteors were big enough to cause a cataclysm on a global scale… Once it became clear that the Guardian Angels would not be able to avert disaster, panic took hold of the population completely. The whole world began to scream… . But the cosmic forces that guided the comet were callously indifferent to the cries of Mankind. Several fragments of the comet, the largest measuring over four kilometres across, crashed down onto the planet, scouring enormous craters, devastating the landscape, provoking gigantic fires, and terrifying tsunamis. Colossal clouds of black dust shot up into the atmosphere. The air became chokingly hot . and dry. Millions upon millions of people perished in the cataclysm, and millions more met the same fate in the weeks that followed. For the survivors, a new age of chaos and desolation had just begun, the age of Dark Earth. ",

    "content": "“… I made my way slowly over the glutinous earth, head hunched, my dogskin cloak pulled up around my neck to protect my throat from the damp, dustladen wind. I kept my eyes fixed to the ground for fear of falling unwittingly into one of those deep ditches brimming with icy mud. But even so, I tried to walk more quickly. With only a few hours remaining before total darkness, I had to hurry back to the Stallite if I wanted to have the slightest chance of seeing the light of the Sun God ever again…” . The cataclysm caused dramatic changes in the Earth’s climate. Besides the total destruction of the lands around the impact zones, the fires caused by burning detritus and the giant tidal waves, some things have changed for ever. The Black Shroud, the cloud of dust that hangs in the sky, has made the Earth a cold, dark world. Away from the shafts of light, the temperature rarely rises above 10°C in the equatorial regions and can fall as low as -40°C at night in the former temperate zones. Storms of black hailstones regularly beat down on the caravans of the bold nomads who travel the roads from Stallite to Stallite. The rain is also black and sometimes acid, so exposure must be kept to a minimum. Deprived of light, most plants were no longer able to photosynthesize, condemning many herbivorous species to death and reducing the amount of oxygen in the air. As the ground is covered by powdery, grey dust, dust storms are no rare occurrence. Asphyxia is the punishment for those careless enough to get caught in a storm. One of the gravest dangers is still the deposits of bubbling, pulsating dark substance that pepper the desert regions. It is said that a fate worse than death awaits any who touch it and live… . After the cataclysm, many dormant volcanoes became active once more, and from time to time blow out wreaths of smoke, clouds of ash and rivers of lava. Worse still, several nuclear power stations and waste processing plants were destroyed in the disaster, inundating vast swathes of land with radioactive dust. These regions and those with strong concentrations of a strange dark substance, have been christened “Deadlands” by the inhabitants of Dark Earth. ",

    "content": "“… The dog lay in wait, silently, hidden among the clumps of grey-headed fungi. Now and again, a bird landed on one of the big mushrooms, tearing off a few rubbery pieces before flying away. The dog did not budge. He knew he had no chance of reaching the bird before it flew off. After a short time, however, it’s eye was caught by another movement in among the sparse vegetation, a fleeting glimpse of tawny-grey fur, scuttling between two small, blackish plants. His nose began to twitch, his muscles tensed under the black hair of his legs. He waited a few more seconds, then sprang. His victim, a fat, furry rat, had no time to react. With a snap of the jaws the dog broke the rat’s neck before guzzling it down. A meal, but not enough. He raised his head and sniffed before settling down patiently to await his next prey. He had not done badly today, all things considered, but no doubt tomorrow he would have to find a new place…” . The cataclysm had dramatic consequences for all the Earth’s flora and fauna. The fires and floods devastated certain regions of the world beyond hope of recovery. But the greatest damage to the plan kingdom was done by the cloud of residual dust that prevented photosynthesis. Only the hardiest plant species have survived, some algae, and also lichens and fungi, now some of the main sources of food for humans and animals. The only remaining chlorophyll plants are those that can survive with little light, and are dark in colour, ranging from brown to black, contributing to the sinister air of desolation of the wild Darklands. A few Stallites have greenhouses where a few plants and flowers subsist in their original form. On Dark Earth, the gift of a rose is a rare event, reserved for the privileged few. As may be expected, the disappearance of a large proportion of the vegetation has wreaked havoc in the food chain. Every animal, from the smallest to the largest, suffered terribly in the wake of the cataclysm. The large herbivores, such as horses, cattle, and elephants, were the first to die, in their tens of millions. Due to the cruel shortage of prey, carnivores also died in great numbers. Omnivores were perhaps the ones who fared best, but still many of them died of hunger, cold, or disease. Many animals, such as birds, monkeys, apes, and rodents, also died because the bushes and trees in which they lived were destroyed. While some species of insects had an easy time living on wilting and rotting vegetation, the good times did not last long. However, thanks to their incredible ability to adapt, insects and arachnids soon got used to the new climate. Most of them now live deep underground. The ones seen most often in the cities are ants, spiders, and scorpions, and certain mutant species are widely feared because of their deadly poison. In the first few years after the cataclysm, birds were able to survive in the stale air because of the proliferation of insects, but with no trees to perch in and no landmarks for migration, they were forced to change their way of life. Now, most of them live around the Stallites and settle on the buildings. Humans leave them alone, since birds have been divinized by the cult of the Great Solaar. Travellers who look at a Well of Sacred Light from afar often see hundreds of birds flying endlessly round and round, as if trying to reach the Sun God. Most animals have reverted to the wild and are ruled by their instincts. However, there are still some domesticated or half-tame dogs in the Stallites. Now and again, people will have a pet snake or even a cat. Some Stallites are famous for the tame bears owned by the Guardians of Fire. ",

    "content": "“… I am Ruel, Guardian of Fire in the Stallite Dohymion. With ten other men, I guard the North Gate. I have not been a Guardian for long. They gave me this job when Hulvar Regtorn did not return from an expedition into the Darklands. But they say I am doing well. True enough, there is no-one quicker than I am at lighting the lamppoles that blaze around the city walls. While I was on my rounds yesterday, a small group of nomads arrived at the gate. I could see on their faces that their journey had been hard and that they were relieved to have reached the safety of the Stallite Dohymion. Their eyes rejoiced with the pleasure of light, their skin with the pleasure of warmth, their mouths with the pleasure of laughter. There and then, I understood how much more agreeable my life was than theirs. I lifted my eyes in silent prayer to the Sun God, asking him to keep sending us light and warmth against the darkness…” . Physical appearance . The men and women of Dark Earth are mostly of medium height and fairly stocky. Their skin is fair (even the skin of African peoples is now markedly lighter) and their eyes are pale. Most people can see in the dark, at least to some degree, and they have developed great resistance to cold and toxins. Their muscles are fine and firm, and though they eat little, their bodies store the fat to protect them from the cold. For the same reason, they are also hairier than their ancestors. Their clothing is of varying type and origin, but rarely in good condition - life is hard and materials are in much shorter supply than in earlier days. Animal skins and furs are used, as are old, very hard-wearing fabrics left over from Before, also wool, cotton, and linen in the regions where these crops have survived. While the Lightdwellers, the inhabitants of the Stallites, can wear fairly light clothing, those who venture out into the Darklands, especially the nomad “Wanderers”, are swathed from head to foot in the strongest, warmest clothing possible. The Wanderers often wear rudimentary sunglasses to protect their eyes from the sunlight, particularly after a period spent in the Darklands. Political and social organization . Most of the descendants of the survivors have gathered for protection in the Stallites where they have built fortified camps, sometimes on the ruins of old cities. They are known as Lightdwellers. The others, called the Wanderers, have chosen - or been forced - to take to the road, travelling from Stallite to Stallite in search of riches, ancient treasures, or simply somewhere to live. Most of them will find only a violent death at the end of a difficult life. Although the Lightdwellers are often wary of the Wanderers - some of them are banished criminals and others have returned from their journeys unnervingly changed - they need them for their supplies of building materials and other commodities. And admittedly, many Lightdwellers admire the Wanderers for the courage and adventurous spirit. Organization of the Stallites Though the Stallites are of very different shapes and sizes, they are organized in the same general way. The Stallites are surrounded by a protective wall, a wooden fence, or a stone wall, designed to protect the city from intruders or wild beasts from the Darklands. Besides their physical defences, the Stallites also enjoy mystical protection of the Mystic Guardians. Most of them are still buried in the ground, but some have been partially or completely unearthed. The Sunseers have declared them to be sacred object and it is forbidden for anyone apart from them to touch them. In the middle of the Stallite stands the Great Temple, the nerve centre of the city of light. The Great Temple is generally the largest and most impressive building. While the structure and shape of the Temples vary from city to city, all of them are brightly lit. During the day, a ray of light from the sky crosses the centre of the Temple. The faithful prostrate themselves before the Rahal, the symbol of the Sun, suspended in the light. The Company of the Guardians of Fire, a massive, squat building, is usually not far from the Great Temple, generally next to a well. Other, smaller companies are situated along the ramparts. The rest of the buildings and houses are arranged differently from Stallite to Stallite, with fields and orchards generally situated around the edge of the city. Castes and professions . The population of the Stallites is generally divided into five distinct castes or groups. As religion has taken a dominant place in human civilization, the Stallites are governed by the priests, the Sunseers, assisted by their strongmen, the Guardians of Fire. Next in order come the Builders and the Providers, essential people who account for just over half the population. The Scavengers are the rabble of the Lightdwellers. The Sunseers . The Sunseers are the priests of the Sun God or Great Solaar. Their prayers and offerings are given up so that Great Solaar will continue to smile on the cities of light. They also teach the Lightdwellers to worship the Sun God and ensure that everyone takes part in the ceremonies as befits their station. They are also the guardians of science and knowledge. They provide medical care and teach reading and writing. Their clothing, which may vary from one Stallite to another, is always light-coloured. It attracts light and reflects it back, illuminating the souls around it. Even more than the rest of the population, the Sunseers love quartz and crystals, using them as decoration and for jewellery. The Council of the Seven, presided by the Great Prôneur, rules the Stallite. It organizes food distribution, collection and cleaning expeditions outside the city walls and, when necessary, sits in judgment of the crimes committed within the Stallite. The Sunseers have absolute power inside the Stallite. The population accepts the fact (though not always gracefully) insofar as the Sunseers are the guarantors of light and there is nothing worse than the shadows of the Darklands. The Guardians of Fire . The Guardians of Fire can be considered to be the “right hand” of the Sunseers. They are strong, practical men, used to being out and about, whereas the Sunseers rarely leave the neighbourhood of the Great Temple. They are in charge of security inside the Stallite and of keeping watch over the perimeter to ensure that no intruders can get in. At night, it is their task to keep the huge torches burning that light up the city, on the ramparts and in the most thickly populated areas. They light the huge braziers around which the people of the poor districts gather to seek warmth; they also supply torches and fuels to those in need. A specialist branch of the Guardians of Fire, the Oilmen, press certain types of plants to extract a thick oil which makes excellent fuel. For instance, a bowl of roueg oil (from a black plant that is also used to make fabric) will burn for several hours. The Guardians of Fire are also in charge of the FaRaha, a system of mirrors set atop the highest buildings and which can send a powerful ray of light sweeping across any part of the Stallite and can also be used to signal to Wanderers heading for the city from the Darklands. Some of the most highly place Guardians of Fire still know how to use and repair electrical circuits. Others try to invent new ways of producing light and making it last. If there is a fire, the Guardians also act as firefighters. The Builders . The builders are the workers and craftsmen of the Stallite. They construct and maintain all the buildings in the city, make sure that the city walls are sound, and make furniture and tools for the Lightdwellers. The miners working in the salt, coal, and mineral mines are also Builders. They are tough men, used to danger and death because they often work in the Darklands. The Sunseers centralize and distribute the fruits of the labour of the Builders. Builders are obviously given some of the nicest housing and will have the best possible furniture and household goods. The Providers . The Providers are the farmers and hunters of Dark Earth. They have the difficult but vital task of tending the few fields and orchards within the walls of the Stallite, raising cattle, finding game or even recovering food from Before (cans, freeze-dried foodstuffs) from the ruins all around. The Sunseers demand a contribution from each of the Providers, which is then redistributed to the rest of the population. The Providers can then do what they like with what is left. The Scavengers . The Scavengers form the majority of the poor population of the Stallites. Some of them are simply too old or too young to be part of another caste. Others are invalids, or incapable or unwilling to pursue any productive activity. The Scavengers manage to survive by sifting through garbage or scouring abandoned or ruined places to find anything they can use to barter for food, a warm place or a little light. Some Scavengers live by burgling and thieving, even though they will pay a high price if caught (being banished from the Stallite by the Sunseers is almost the same as a death sentence). Others take the risk of volunteering for the exploration expeditions organized by the Sunseers, which venture out of the Stallite and are sometimes gone for weeks. Religion . The cult of the Sun God, Great Solaar, or Father of Light, is the central pillar of human society on Dark Earth. The only remaining islands of civilization all stand on sacred site protected by the Sun God. In each of the Stallites, the Sunseers, the priests of the Sun God, have complete control over the lives of all the inhabitants. The Sunseers’ creed is simple. The Sun God protects Mankind against the Darkness. He is the fount of all life, to be feared and respected. The Sun God is considered to be an almighty being who sees everything that men do. He brings light and life to those who worship him, while those who offend him or his servants will be consumed by fire. It is said that when men have cleansed and purified their souls and the Earth, the Sun God will send his children to rid the world of the Black Shroud. Darkness will be banished for ever more and the whole planet will be bathed in the life-giving light of the Sun God. The symbol of the Sun God is a white circle from which descend three vertical bands, like rays of sunlight. The symbol is to be seen in various forms on all religious objects. The Sunseers shave their heads and paint them with the sacred symbol, the central band reaching down to the chin, and the two lines either side down to the cheek bones. This is to show that the Sun God is master of their thoughts, sees through their eyes, and speaks through their mouths. Because of their closeness to the Sun God, to whom they have devoted their lives, the Sunseers are considered to be holy and are revered by the other inhabitants of the Stallite. They regulate the lives of the Lightdwellers, distribute food and goods, deliver justice. Just one word of the Sunseers is enough for a man convicted of a crime or of blasphemy to be banished to the Darklands with his entire family. Which, more often than not, means they are condemned to die. The Wanderers are less religious than the Lightdwellers. Nevertheless, most of them would still say that they believed in the Sun God. How else can you explain these great wells of daylight that pierce the Black Shroud? . Many bands of Wanderers have a mystic amongst them who helps sustain the faith of his companions. And whatever they may personally think, the Wanderers need contact with the Sunseers too much ever to go against them. Changing times, changing ways Owing to the harsh living conditions after the cataclysm, Mankind’s mores, manners, and principles have changed considerably. Deprived of the comforts and safety of technology, men’s instincts quickly took over. Only the hardiest were able to survive the catastrophes, the diseases, the rarefaction of oxygen, and the food shortages, and gradually adapt to the new world. In this wild, savage, unforgiving environment, men became hardened. If need be, they can be merciless. But they have also learned to appreciate the benefits of togetherness and the value of human life. Communal life . A solitary existence is a precarious thing on Dark Earth. Men soon came to understand that, in order to survive, they had to share their knowledge and skills and live together to be able to subsist and defend themselves. Even the most unsociable Wanderers travel in small bands. The only exceptions are the lone hunters, a few mystics who have taken a vow of solitude, and those who have been stricken with contagious diseases and head off alone to die in the Darklands… Alone, that is, unless they find the mythical Clan of the Damned, a group of nomads whose members, according to legend, are all diseased, disabled, deformed, incurable, or crippled. Life in the Stallites . Each Stallite is different. Some were built on open land, others on the ruins of pre-Cataclysm cities. The Sunseers, Guardians of Fire, Builders, and Providers often have solid stone houses. The Scavengers, however, live in abandoned buildings, shacks, or old underground shelters. The Wanderers live in thick tents that look a little like Indian tepees. When travelling, they carry their tents on their backs or put them on a cart, setting them up at every stop if they have not managed to find a safer or ore comfortable refuge. Food . The diet of the people of Dark Earth is considerably different to the food of pre- Cataclysm days. The staple food is the big mushrooms that grow almost everywhere around the Stallites and in the Darklands. They also make soups and stews from roots and savoury plants. For meat, they eat rats, mice, snakes and some of the larger insects. Besides the few cattle and pigs bred by the Providers, hunters sometimes bring back wild boars, bears, dogs, or some other wild animal. This type of meat is rare and is reserved for special occasions - or for the most influential people. The Providers who tend the land are able to grow various fruits and vegetables, though these cannot be compared to those available Before. Unfortunately, there are never enough to go round, which means that only a privileged few ever get to taste them. To drink, there is water from the springs and wells, filtered through fine-mesh sieves. The water is often polluted, but the Inhabitants of Dark Earth have become resistant to it over the years. Some Providers distil a strong alcohol from mushrooms, and a few people are lucky enough to taste ancient drinks, dug up from the ruins of the cities of Before. Conjugal life . Given the short life expectancy - people rarely live beyond the age of 50 - and the high infant mortality rate, couples form at a very young age, around 15 or 16. Polygamy is thought to be quite natural and is encouraged by religion in some Stallites. Women, who are often just as hard-boiled as men, are paid great respect, and their maternal role is considered all-important. While they are unlikely to tremble with fear when faced with a band of marauders or an angry bear, most women are struck with terror at the thought of being sterile. On Dark Earth, sterility is a source of shame and a loss of social standing. The birth of a child is always greeted with pride and is an occasion for great rejoicing. Childhood . Up to the age of three, children are pampered and protected as much as possible from the rigours of the climate. They are the future of the human race and adults will do all in their power to help them. Despite that fact, infant mortality remains high. A child officially reaches majority at age 12. A religious ceremony is held, which places the child under the protection of Great Solaar and makes him either a full citizen of the Stallite or an active member of the clan, depending on whether he is a Lightdweller or a Wanderer. Once adult, the child must do his share to keep his family alive and become part of the social group to which he belongs. Death . When a man dies, custom dictates that his body be burned so that his soul can go to join the Sun God. Leaving the body of an enemy to rot in the open air or, worse still, to bury it, is the surest way to condemn his soul to perdition. If the cremated man was righteous, his soul will rise straightaway to joint the Sun God. If he was a heretic, his soul must roam the Darklands for ever. If he has sinned but has repented, he will have a chance to reach the sun by being reincarnated in the form of a bird. For that reason, birds are considered to be sacred and inviolable animals. To harm a bird or eat its flesh is a mortal sin, a crime against the Sun God. However, the Wanderers (and starving Lightdwellers) rarely keep this commandment, to the great horror of the pious. Education . The only school on Dark Earth is the school of life. However, those who can read and write are greatly respected, as are those who still retain scraps of the culture of the days Before. In the Stallites, and to a lesser extent in the Wanderer clans, there are often people who are prepared to teach children and other adults in exchange for food and lodging. The Sunseers, the guardians of knowledge, also teach reading and writing, but devote most of their time to the future members of their own order. Art . Given the inhospitable conditions of life on Dark Earth, Art has become a secondary consideration, but it can still be found in the work of some craftsmen, such as goldsmiths and metalworkers. Most of the metal used has been recovered from the ruins of the cities of Before, and is worked on anvils or with blowlamps. Another material in no short supply is bone. Animal or, more rarely, human skeletons are used to make jewellery, small decorative, or useful objects, and so on. Music has also survived the cataclysm. There are flutes, harps or, much less frequently; musical instruments from Before that have miraculously survived. The songs tell stories of the golden age of Before or the adventures of one of the heroes of Dark Earth. Horns are used to sound the alert, as their powerful notes carry far. Crafts . Some of the most widely respected Builders are the glassmakers. They work almost exclusively on religious artefacts for the Sunseers: glass tables, windows, sun symbols, etc. Given the amount of fuel and energy required to produce glassware, the glassmakers’ creations are very highly valued. Like glass, crystals are also very highly prized by the Inhabitants of Dark Earth. According to popular belief, crystals and quartz are the tears shed by the Sun God when the cataclysm occurred. Wood being rare, carpenters and cabinet makers have been replaced by metalworkers and welders. In most Stallites, metal is widely used. It is the most resistant material and the one that suffers the least deterioration. Chromed and polished metal are wonderful for catching and reflecting the light of the Sun God. Sculptors and masons also have the wherewithal to work. The techniques of working with stone are a mixture of knowledge from Before and experience gleaned since the cataclysm. There are also bone sculptors who mainly produce small artefacts such as jewellery, knives, cups and so on. The craft of weaving also survived the cataclysm, but the materials are different from those used Before. Animal fibres are rare; the fleeces of domestic and wild sheep are generally used to make blankets or for collars and coats. Vegetable fibres are the ones most freely available. A tough, stringy plant called roueg is used to make hard-wearing but terribly rough clothes. Technology . Although some hypersophisticated equipment survived the cataclysm, the level of technology of Dark Earth has fallen extremely low. The secrets of how to operate the most complicated machines and devices were lost in one or two generations after the disaster, the survivors being too busy in clinging on to life to bother about “useless” skills. At present, only a few people still understand about electricity and know how to maintain and repair simple machines. But in Stallites all around the world, there are always a few inquisitive souls who seek to understand and use the almost magical technology of Before, such as electricity or internal combustion engines. Despite the presence of these relics of Before, daily life has returned to the Middle Ages. Fire is used for heating, lighting and cooking. Clothes are made from vegetable and animal fibres, tanned skins and salvaged materials (non- degradable plastic, metals. Power is supplied by natural energy: wind engines, paddle wheels, steam engines, etc. Coal and mineral mines have been reopened, and the work is often difficult and dangerous, but the energy that they provide is extremely precious. Most of the vehicles are drawn by animals - tamed bears, dogs, oxen - but some ingenious inventors have developed wind-powered vehicles which sometimes work very well. Trade and barter . On Dark Earth, money has no currency, except in certain Stallites that have their own coinage. Trade is based on barter. All material goods are traded in this way: food, fuel, lighting, clothing, weapons… . The objects with the greatest value are durable sources of light left over from Before: portable generators, electric lamps, oil lamps, etc. But these are often in the hands of the Sunseers. Firearms are also highly prized, as is ammunition. Next in value are clothes, manufactured weapons (daggers, swords, crossbows), game and drinking water, foodstuffs from Before and finally everyday objects • . ",

    "content": "The Darklands is the name given to all the lands that lie outside the Stallites, beyond the ramparts and the perimeter of the Well of Sacred Light. 98% of the Darklands is uninhabited, as life there is extremely hard. Only the hardiest of wild beasts roam its desert wastes. But these lands are also haunted by the creatures, more dangerous than the most savage of beasts. The Wanderers, the men who travel the Darklands, linking one Stallite to the next, always have many terrifying tales to tell about the denizens of the “land of shadows” that they have met or fought against. According to some of them, there are black fortresses in the Darklands, built and inhabited by extremely aggressive and violent men. The Monasteries . Creatures are not the only population to live in the Darklands. Human refuges, called Monasteries, are tiny glimmers of hope in the darkness. These are small citadels, protected by strong defences (moats, ramparts, spikes, double gates) and armed men. In these Monasteries, communities of Sunseers are sometimes to be found, coming to the aid of travellers seeking sanctuary. A number of Monasteries are used as bases for expeditions to destroy the creatures and Shankreatures. Also in the Darklands are buildings occupied by miners, in areas where the mines are too far from their home Stallite, and prison camps where life is particularly difficult. ",

    "title": "Darkness and Light",
    "content": "On Dark Earth, life follows the rhythm of alternating darkness and light. The Inhabitants of Dark Earth have mystical explanations for the cycle of day and night and other cosmic phenomena. For them, day following night, night following day is the materialization of the never- ending struggle between the Sun God and the forces of Darkness. Each night, many people believe that dawn will never come. But each day, the victorious sun reappears, and with it the life-giving light. Inhabitants of Dark Earth see sunlight as a gift from their god. Its mystical character is reinforced by the violent winds that blow each day as the air warms up. The stars that can be seen at night through the holes in the Black Shroud are the distant flashes of battle between the Sun and Darkness. The moon, which is only seen occasionally, is considered to be the messenger of the Sun God, and sight of it is deemed to be a good portent for the Stallite over which it floats. When the first glimmers of light appear in the black dome of the sky, prayers are said to thank the Sun God for bringing light and heat back to his people. And as night falls, all kneel before the symbol of the Sun God to ask his forgiveness for their sins and the return of day after night. The heat-stroke, sunstroke and loss of vision that beset the Wanderers who are not used to the light of the Stallites are interpreted as mystical signs. That is how the Sun God tests the Wanderers who dare to step into his sacred light. Those who come to be able to protect themselves from the effects of sunlight and are accepted by the Sunseers are then allowed to become Lightdwellers. • . ",

Here is a list of the casts by order of importance: . The Sunseers, servants of the Sun God who run the Stallites. The Healers who are Sunseers in charge of medicine. The Guardians of Fire, responsible for the security and respect of the law. The Builders, responsible for construction. The Providers who feed the town. The Scavengers, who make up the population of the Stallites. The Sunseers, Guardians of Fire and the Builders live in the magnificent Upper Town while the ‘lower casts’ are crammed into the Lower Town, an enormous slum, surviving as best they can depending on their abilities. Sometimes the ‘Wanderers’, travellers from the Darklands are allowed to enter the Stallites. ",

Don’t worry, being a Guardian of Fire is not that bad, it can even lead you to unexpected and unusual jobs. You are therefore one of the guards who has just woken up after a strange dream (the dream is the cinematic scene at the beginning), at your side is the gentle Kalhi, a young scavenger. Get up and get ready, put your uniform on and get your sword. You are advised not to eat the salt beef that is on your bedside table, as you will need it later. Zed, one of your guardian friends is waiting for you outside and asks you if you want to train with him in the weapons room. You are recommended to follow him if you have no idea of the methods of combat in the game. You will also find Captain Phédoria there, this beautiful young woman, an excellent fighter, will join your practice with zeal. It is up to you to make the most of these warm ups to understand the art of combat in Dark Earth. In the training room you will find an axe. Leave it where it is, you may need it later. Go downstairs and receive your orders from the provost Dhorkan. The entrance to his office is guarded, make sure that you are in “Light” mode and speak to the guard in front of the door, he will let you enter. Once in front of the provost you will receive your orders: He sends you to guard the entrance to the chamber of the Council of Sunseers (the highest authority in the Stallite) who have a meeting with the Scavengers from the Lower Town. Go down the stairs and run to the temple of the Sun God, it is on the left-hand side when you come out of the barracks. You arrive in front of the entrance and surprise Lory and Rylsadhar, your father, a Sunseer also, deep in conversation. After having listened to them you must go to the entrance to the Council chamber. NB: if you wish, you can also go and speak to the guardians of fire in the barracks, go and talk to your father or even tease Zed on the platform that leads to the Lower town. Once inside the temple, join your colleague Jedar who is waiting for you in a bad mood ( Arkhan has the bad habit of being late). Make sure that you have your sword in your hand and be on guard. You and your colleague are suddenly alerted by a loud noise from the interior of the chamber. The cinematic scene that follows your entrance shows the assassination of the two Councillors and poor Jedar (not a good day for him!). Go into combat mode and kill the bastard that attacks you! . Once you have won the combat you see (cinematic) Lory being attacked by a second person and run to help the great Sunseer, you receive a cup of poison directly in the face. You fall to the ground unable to do anything and paralysed with pain, only the fortunate intervention of Zed and his Python 357 pistol save you from certain death before blacking out. ",

    "content": "Once the delirium (in which you learn of your contamination by the Darkness) is over you wake up in a hospital; you are in the hospital where the Healer Sunseers take care of you. It is unnecessary to say that your quest begins here and that your time is short, in that an awful illness, “The evil of the Darkness” is within you and threatens your own humanity. Once up you are immediately attacked by Dulnys, A Guardian of Fire frightened by your new appearance. You have no choice but to kill him (if you can, go and find the knife in the other part of the room). Once Dulnys is dead take his weapon, Thanandar, the Healer comes into the room almost immediately. Talk with him to explain what happened and above all do not go outside until he has shouted to Phédoria (outside) that all is well. He then explains to you that the guard was no more than an ignorant fanatic, he also tells you (it seems) all he can on the subject of your illness. He speaks of a mysterious crypt in which you can be healed, apparently only your father knows how to get there. After these clarifications go to Thanandar’s laboratory and take the gas canister from Before (right of the screen) and the knife (left) if you do not already have it. Save your game by activating the symbol of the Sun God on the wall, leave the hospital and go to your father’s apartments which are on the small square with the fountain. Once inside, you go to the shelves that are in the entrance and take the empty flask which is there. Speak to your father Rylsadhar about your illness. He is ready to anything to help you. To do this he must ask Dhorkan’s express permission to break certain laws, he says he will meet you at the archivist’s which is not far from the Council Chamber, Khali arrives at the same time. Once Rylsadhar has left, find the document that is under his bed, a kind of mysterious code. Khali cannot help you, as a scavenger she never had the opportunity to learn to read. The platform that links the Upper and Lower Towns is now under surveillance. Be extremely careful, since the assassination attempt against Lory the situation has become extremely tense, you look bad and the Guardians of Fire will be looking for you. It is however possible to try and convince them, solidarity between brothers in arms obliges! Fore this type of negotiation it is preferable to be in “Light” mode. Leave Rylsadhar’s room and go back up to the temple (you will be subjected to a diatribe from a fanatic Sunseer). In the Council chamber go up the staircase on the left and enter by the door on the left. Once inside you will find Sesekan the archivist at work. Speak to him and get some information. It is important to know that he has not seen your father all day (strange!) and he gives you some more information about your possible cure. Turn around and examine the piece of furniture to the right of the door, you see a mirror from Before. Reading the spell book that is open next to the wall you also have the possibility to learn more about the history of Sparta, in that way you can spread your knowledge to the inhabitants of the Lower Town. Near this book is a kind of mechanism. Use it with the document that you found under your father’s bed: You discover a secret hide out. Inside there is a metal plate a little like the score for an organ grinder. You do not have to use it but it might help you get into the famous crypt that Thanandar spoke of. Leave and return to the barracks. You can stop at the foot of the stairs that lead to apartments on the upper floors, you will find a barrel of stohll (mushroom based alcohol) on the table. Take the empty gourd that is on one of the barrels behind the table, fill it up and go upstairs. You can also go and get your meat that was in your apartment at the beginning of the adventure. If you go upstairs take the axe, be very careful of Phédoria: Speak to her in “Light” mode and without the axe in your hand otherwise she will not hesitate in putting an end to your slow decline. One equipped, leave by the glass doors to go out onto the balcony (at the end of the hall, behind the staircase). ",

They are boilers for a spitrod, the ammunition for the handmade weapons used by the Guardians of Fire of Sparta. Take them all as well as the plates of lead which are on the shelves in front of the staircase. After that, climb, do not pay attention to the man that is working, it is Bogdaran, the Master Oiler, he is not very talkative and he is afraid of you. There is therefore no point in disturbing him. Return to the shelves to your left and take the key. Go downstairs and go toward the chest that is to the left of the door. Open it with the key that you found on the shelves, take Bogdaran’s old uniform. Return to the balcony and go and open the door opposite: It is the barrack prison. Once you are inside, take out your weapon and change to combat mode. Go down the steps and kill the jailer. You will find his weapon on him as well as the keys to the cell behind you. What are you waiting for? Open the cell. Good, remember that martial law has been imposed and your love, Kalhi the scavenger did not have the right to be in the Upper Town. Do not be surprised when you find her locked up (and happy to see you!) in the cell. Give her the old uniform and let her do her own thing, which is the best thing you’ll have done since this morning. Follow her and pretend to be her prisoner, you can then easily pass the security checks in the barracks. Kalhi offers to divert the guard on the passage, when she has finished speaking to him and he leaves for the barracks, hide behind the cart that is in front of the lift, let the guard pass and return to your love. Place yourself behind the console and activate the leer to go down. Down to the Lower Town! . NB: You can also forget the idea of the disguise and fight your way to the Lower Town (with Kalhi). It is a lot more difficult as the Guardians of Fire are tough but it is also an opportunity to collect some weapons, namely a spitrod from the platform guard. ",

On leaving Danrys cross the square (you can talk to the legless invalid but be careful he is sensitive) and search the area until you find a breastplate. Do not hesitate to save the game. Once you have collected the breastplate leave the square by the left-hand side. Keep going until you find yourself in front of a tavern situated in front of a passage which crosses many of the canals of the Lower Town. Enter the bar and enjoy the show… . When Delia, the stripper has finished dancing follow her backstage and talk to her. If you bring her something shiny and beautiful she will help you get in touch with Armal Sadak, the best-known scavenger of the Lower Town. You are in possession of the type of precious material that Delia is looking for: “The Mirror of Before”. Delia will be very happy with the present and will tell you the magic words that you must use when in the presence of Armal Sadak for him to help you. The hideout of this precious ally is a boat on the quay, on the right a little after the tavern. Armal will stay behind the table which is on your left when you enter, approach him and start talking to him. He will suggest you play a game of Yong (a game inspired by Othello). If you win he will give you all the information you need (or nearly). You don’t have to play Sadak but the information he can give you will help you understand what is going on in Sparta. You will learn that the troublemakers who attacked Lory are called Konkalites (their chief, Sordos is the old right hand man of Sadak). Their base is somewhere in the depths of the Lower Town. The only problem, each time you play Sadak you must bet one of your weapons and whatever the result of the game, you lose. NB : If you do not have the mirror from before for Delia it is possible to get help from Danrys who also knows Armal Sadak. Go back and see Danrys after having seen Armal Sadak at least once and he will give you the password. ",

    "content": "Leave Armal’s den and go to the end of the passageway that leads to his boat. The more attentive of you will notice the entrance to the Stallite’s underground sewer system. A skull that decorates the vault marks the entrance to the hide out. Go to the part of the passageway that does not have a barrier and jump into the water by pressing on the space bar. Once inside you are welcomed by a loud sneeze. The message is clear, you are not alone and the Konkalites that are waiting for you are clearly not overly concerned with discretion! . Change to combat mode now and take out your weapon (if you have one). Kill the two men that attack you, it’s not worth trying to take a more diplomatic approach during these first encounters with the Konkalites. After having sent your enemies’ souls into the darkness do not forget to go through their pockets. It is equally the case for the last two, even if their bodies have disappeared under water. Position yourself where their bodies disappeared and press on the space bar, you will find their weapons. There is no shame in taking them, as it is entirely possible that your weapon gets broken during combat. Go up the staircase and save the game when you get to the other side of the passageway. Go down carefully, You will see a meeting of these terrors of the sewers. You will easily recognise the people who were responsible for attacking the Council Chamber. Their chief, Sordos confirms your suspicions as he speaks to, and kills the last person alive after the failed mission (you received the poison rather than the Great Sunseer!). After the meeting, one of these delightful characters approaches you. You know what happens by now! Get out your favourite weapon and kill him straight away. Now you can approach the main room of the Konkalites’ hide out in peace. Quickly approach the two guards in front of the chief’s door. If you are quick enough you can offer them a drink of stohll. That will help you avoid a fight, if you speak to the Konkalites before getting them completely drunk you will learn a lot of information. Once on the other side, you find yourself in Sordos’s apartments, but he is not alone: Thanandar, your so-called ally is there. Not only does he seem dubious in his determination to “cure” the cadaver that you left in the hospital but he also informs you of the kidnapping of your father. There is something rotten in the kingdom of Sparta! In addition, Thanandar orders Sordos to kill you immediately. Sordos is well armed and if you feel like avoiding the fight by leaving the room, a Konkalite will knock you down before you know what’s hit you. There is no possible escape; you will have to defeat both Sordos and Thanandar! Do not underestimate this little bald and sickly warrior, he fights a lot better than you imagine. Are you still alive? Well done, now check their bodies. You will get the weapon from the fat Sordos as well as his key and a weapon design. There are even more interesting things on Thanandar. You will find a red key and a potion that reduces the effects of the evil that has invaded your body. Save it and only use it in an emergency. NB: The red key that Thanandar had stolen from your father is used to activate the giant crystal in the Rahal Chamber in the temple. Use the key with the metal plate that you found in the Archivist’s room, it will get you into the crypt. After having checked the bodies on the ground, now turn your attention to the rest of the room. You will find food if you look in the barrels and casks that are against the wall. Open the chest with Sordos’s key: You will find a very interesting document. Read it, it is the irrefutable proof of the alliance between the Provost Dhorkan and Sordos. The traitor! . This really is not a good day! . Alternative route . If you do not want to confront the Konkalites, there is another way of confronting Thanandar. Rather than going to see Sordos, go up to the Upper City and go and see Thanandar at the hospital. He is now accompanied by a Konkalite who is (very badly) disguised as a Guardian of Fire. Thanandar will be courteous when you visit the first time, but the second time the Konkalite will attack you. Be ready to defend yourself! . ",

Leave the sewers and go and find Danrys, Give him the weapon design and the handle. He promises to build you a new weapon: The Flame-thrower, leave him to it and go back to the Upper City. Go towards the barracks and be prepared to speak with all your old colleagues in order for them let you pass. Cross the building and go to the Provost Dhorkan’s door which is guarded by Captain Phedoria. Approach him and speak with him, show him the document that you found in the Konkalite hide out. Convinced, Phedoria asks you to arrest Dhorkan. As you enter Dhorkan’s office you see the traitor leaving via a secret passage that closes behind him. Let Phedoria go and alert the Great Sunseer’s guards. You must go and find a stiletto that is in the left-hand drawer of the desk in the middle of the room. Go to the spot where the entrance to the secret passage had closed, examine the wall and insert the stiletto knife into the opening that you find. The passage opens (and stays open for future use), go inside and climb down the steps at the bottom of which you find your father, also contaminated and in agony. He explains Thanandar’s terrible plan and you learn that he is in fact not dead (the Evil of the Darkness allowed him to recover from your attack). Once your father has breathed his last breath there is no point in checking his pockets, they are empty and anyway, it’s not the done thing you heartless person! Follow the passage and you will find yourself in the Lower City. You can go and see Danrys and take your weapon if you want. Do not forget that you have limited ammunition and that you still have many hard adversaries to encounter. Go to Armal Sadak’s hide out and turn left (the way to the ramparts). You will find Kalhi fighting with one of the Scavengers. Explain the fragility of life to her, it’s all you can do. You immediately learn that Kalhi was in fact bargaining. Return to the Upper City via the mechanical platform. Go to the temple and you will find a transformed and powerful 2m60 Thanandar, with a terrible smile. It’s not worth trying anything, Thanandar is no longer human and beats you to the ground immediately, enough time however for Zed to take the passage which leads to the crypt, the “Heart of Light” of the Stallite (under the praetorium in the form of a boat). Fortunately the over confident Thanandar ahs not killed you. Get up after he leaves and go down the stair sbehind Zed who is now contaminated and “controlled” by Thanandar. He touches the “Heart od Light” and corrupts it with the evil poison that Thanandar had taken from his own body. Before dying, Zed has the time to give you his “Tear od Life”, his last strength, in a jet of luminous energy that passes through your body. ",

When you return to the Konkalite hide out they will have transferred Zed to their prison. Once in the Konkalite prison kill the guards and search them. Use the key they have to open the grill at the end of the prison. Zed, in very bad condition waits for you inside (occasion for a moving cinematic scene). Before being taken over by the Evil of the Darkness he reveals Thanandar’s plans to you and gives you his “Tear of Life”. Now there is only the monster left in him.

    "content": "When you leave the crypt (your hopes of being cured lost!), you meet the Great Sunseer and Phedoria. Lory informs you of the worrying state of affairs in the Stallite. Follow her to her “office” above the Council Chamber. There, she informs you of the existence of a “tomb”, the true source of the Stallite’s energy. To find it, you must find what your father had been looking for all his life: The path that leads to the source! In his apartments you find a door that can only be opened with a very special key. It is a crystal key made up of four distinct elements of which the first part is in Lory’s possession, it is the ring that Rylsadhar had given him at the beginning of the day. You must find the three other crystals that make up the key to open your father’s secret cabinet and profit from his research to find the tomb. Even captain Phedoria is counting on you! . The first crystal is in the possession of a master builder Bandor. It is man with black skin and a leg made of steel, he had often worked with your father. When you leave the temple candles light all the Stallite, the Darkness having succeeded in entering the Stallite’s walls following the corruption of the Heart of Light. Thanandar and his diabolical troops risk taking control of the Stallite. Go to the Builders’ building, it is guarded by a vigil dressed in blue. To get in you can of course kill him but you can also offer him some stohll after having given him something salty to eat such as dried meat or fish. He cannot hold alcohol and falls to the ground, drunk. If you choose to kill him, take care of his weapon, it gives him the advantage of distance and causes serious damage. Once the guard is neutralised, go to the end of the corridor and take the lift. When they see you arrive the builders are as surprised as they are terrified. One of the two of them must be Bandor; the only problem is that they both have black skin and a metal leg! Speak to them, of course they refuse to identify themselves. Approach the workbench and take the parchment that you see. Approach one of the fires and threaten to burn the precious plan. Bandor identifies himself, in fear of seeing his work disappear in flames. Go and speak to him and show him the first part of the key you have, he will give you the second part. Return to the lower City using the mechanical platform and go to the bunker of which the entrance is marked with a red cross. Surprise! Dhorkan is there, he is drawing something on the door, take out your weapon and beat him. After your “amicable” agreement search him and, besides his weapons and a map from Before you will find the third part of the crystal key. The map gets you into the bunker; you have to put it in the box that is next to the door. Enter and search the room thoroughly. Behind the door, under a metal plate you will find an object from “Before”, a kind of electronic component with green liquid inside. Continue searching, you will find a gun behind one of the cryogenic cases. As is the case for all the weapons that you have found, you must be sparing with ammunition, even more so with this one, it is extremely powerful and you will find very little appropriate ammunition. Return to the Upper City via the secret passage that ends on Dhorkan’s office. Go to the prison and kill the guard (a man’s gotta do what a man’s gotta do – especially with idiots). Take his keys from him and open the cell to the right. A Konkalite is inside, change to combat mode and kill him. During this brief encounter, the Konkalite speaks of Zed, in light of the fact that you have probably gleaned some information to find the last fragment (we hope you use these solutions consciously), you will undoubtedly have learnt that Zed was one of the people likely to be in possession of it. This Konkalite is in fact one of the two that captured Zed and stole his crystal. Although you find nothing when you search the body of the dead Konkalite, you notice that the bed in the cell has moved. Go into Dark mode and hit the bed. The crystal, hidden behind the bed falls to the ground, pick it up. You have collected all the pieces of the key that is now whole, Well done! . ",

Return to the lower city and go to the bunker (the door marked with red). Go through the door and climb the staircase as far as the guard’s path that goes over the gate to the Stallite. Once on the ramparts you will find the body of a Guardian of Fire, its is not worth checking him. Continue along the ramparts as far as the sentry box where the Wanderer Lodar is fighting a Konkalite. Help the Wanderer and in gratitude, the explorer will give you a helmet. It is the final piece that combined with the gas bottle from Before makes up the aqualung that lets you breath under water. Thank the Wanderer and return to the Lower City. NB: If you kill the Wanderer, you can take the helmet from him, it is also possible that the Konkalite kills Lodar and steals his helmet, in which case you will have to fight him. If the Konkalite gets away, you can get it later at Armal Sadak’s home (who kills the Konkalite to avenge the Wanderer’s death) in exchange for a Yong piece that you found on the Wanderer. Go to the sewers (the banks where the Konkalites live) and onto the passageway which is just after the game save point before the staircase. There is a ladder that goes down into the deep waters of the canal. Put on your wet suit and go down. Once under the water, walk until you see a passage marked by a wrought iron arch. While you walk a creature from the Darklands attacks you. Fortunately it is easy to kill despite being slowed down by the water. As you follow the submerged corridor, check one of the skeletons on your right, you’ll find ammunition in the mud under the ribcage. Once outside, you automatically take of your aqualung. Go into combat mode immediately. A Shankreature jumps down on you from the big cetacean skeleton. The monster is quite vicious and you are allowed to use one of your firearms to get rid of it. Continue along the beach, another Shankreature is in the corner of a cave that is in front of you, same situation, same solution. Pick up the poison that is on the ground in the cave, it’s not very good but it might come in useful… . Continue your path by wading in the black water to go around the rock. You will find yourself in front of the entrance to a vast cave filled with luxuriant vegetation (a miraculous sight on Dark Earth!). Follow the path on the left until you find yourself in front of a pond guarded by a giant snake that you will have to get rid of. Go into the water and climb the staircase that leads to the hide out of Leona, the “Witch”. It is this charming person that your father came to see when he made his excursions into the Darklands. Do not scare her, and listen to what she has to say. She will give you more information concerning the existence of the Tomb and will inform you of the healing qualities of the water that flows at the foot of her shelter. Return the way you had come and drink some water, your life level will reduce dramatically, but the level of Darkness in your blood will also fall. Attention: You can only drink this water twice for an entire life level. If you try again, Arkhan will prevent himself automatically for fear of becoming too weak to continue his mission. Return to the beach and go to the edge of the water where you arrived, put your mask back on and return to the Lower City. This little detour will at least reduce the Darkness that flows in your veins for some time. This will delay your transformation into a creature of the Darkness, which would change your physical appearance to such an extent that it would be useless to try and get help from anybody (apart from a few people), and you still need help! . Alternative route . If, for one reason or another, you have not succeeded in getting the crystals, it is possible to get one from a block of crystal that is near the water where there is the giant snake. To do that you must use the small axe that you found at Danrys’s home. You will get a piece of rough crystal that Danrys can cut in the form of the other crystal keys that you can show him. If Danrys is dead, you can even cut the key yourself. , You will have to put some fuel into the machine the Danrys uses, as it is empty). ",

Stand in front of him and speak to him. He immediately gets scared and hides behind the hopeless barrier of his small arms. Go into combat mode and pretend to hit him once. His little brain reacts and he realises that if you had wanted to kill him you would have done so. From now one, he will have the right attitude for you to have a real conversation. Give him the object from Before and in exchange for a little favour that you must do for him, Bogdaran promises to study the object. But before you must do a little favour, go and get the object of his desire, no other than the dancer Delia, is that all! . Return to the lower city and go to her home, she is still in one piece. Make sure that you are presentable, if your transformation is too advanced she will be afraid and refuse to follow you. You will therefore need to heal yourself by drinking the potion or drinking the spring water in Leona’s cave. If all goes well, speak to Delia and tell her that Bogdaran is among the living, she will be more than happy to follow you. But as soon as you leave the backstage area, Maor the landlord bars your way, he is also contaminated and even uglier than you are! Delia stays away from the combat, try and convince her that you are a good bodyguard. Once you have beaten Maor, Delia will follow you closely and you can go everywhere. Return to the Upper City with the lift, Delia will not dare follow you into Dhorkan’s secret passage. When you arrive you will see signs that clearly say, “all is not well”. Your old colleagues are scattered around on the floor, next to a creature that had clearly done a lot of damage before deciding to die. Go towards the barracks. You will meet a creature that is eating one of your unfortunate colleagues. As usual Delia will take a step back at this point and leave you to deal with the creature alone, be careful; he’s very tough. After the combat go and find Delia if she has not come to join you, and go up to Bogdaran’s laboratory. Bogdaran and Delia are very happy to see each other once again, even if Delia makes it quite clear that she is more impressed by your virility than the Master Oiler’s (speak to him in Dark Mode, you’ll see!). After the thanks, remember to ask Bogdaran what you want to know concerning the object from Before. The object contains a substance that is extremely volatile when in contact with water; one drop of water and it explodes immediately. Fortunately Bogdaran has isolated the substance with oil in order to delay the explosion. However, you really were very lucky when you took the underwater passage with the substance on you! . NB: if Delia does not want to follow you or if Bogdaran is dead, you can always isolate the substance yourself in oil by using the large oil container next to the staircase. ",

Go to the small door that is on the other side of the room, it will close behind you when you pass he threshold. Your journey ends here. The tomb opens onto a very high cliff, it’s not surprising that your father never found the entrance, it was destroyed by the Great Cataclysm! . Return to the very gig door, on each side of the opening you will see two panels with drawings that resemble those that that you saw in your father’s secret laboratory on the parchments. You must use the levers to select the right “runes” to open the door. Start with the panel on the left and compose the following sentence: . “RUNKA-SUN-PROTECTION” . Then pass to the panel on the right and compose: . “PLANET-DESTRUCTION-SHANKR”.

Once the right combination has been activated, the ground starts to tremble as the door pivots to let you in; you are advised to save the game before going any further. Now you are in front of the labyrinth, now activated. It is in fact very simple, the path should be followed to your right and there are not too many paths that go off in all directions. Really, it is very easy. The difficult bit is the rotating blades that are along the length of the passage and that you should try and avoid, they cut your head clean off in one go! . Stay calm and take your time. It is simple to avoid the blades, when one of them comes toward you, press the space bar to duck, press the space bar again to stand up straight and continue. At the end of this passage you will see a game save point that is a little set back from the labyrinth. Light shines through the wall at the end. The door to the tomb seems to be about to open, but you hear a voice from behind you: Thanandar! Your sworn enemy is now before you, entirely transformed; now in the form of an enormous creature…and he’s clearly hungry! Get ready for a hard fight. “One on One”, Thanandar is invincible in this form, there’s no point in beating him to the ground, he’ll get up even stronger and tear you pieces. The only way to destroy him is to open the door to the tomb. Start by knocking out your enemy (use your firearms as much as possible), and use the time that he needs to recover to get to the door, there are two big levers. Push both the levers and a light comes on. You must but the light on the left down, and the light on the right, up in order to activate the mechanism. And all of that before Thanadar gets to you. ",

These gamees shared pre-rendered backgrounds with 3D software rendered characters, a technique use in the early 90s due to hardware constraints. AITD was the pioneer of pre-rendered backgrounds and use static images that were hand drawn on top of wireframes of a 3D scene. Each image corresponding to a different camera view of the scene. LBA did it differently and use isometric sprite composition in order to create a scene and use a single isometric camera view panning around the environment. The isometric scenes were composed in a grid format with limited width, depth and height. Various objects were composed by a number of sprites following a set of standard dimensions and then placed together to create scenes. They are also used for collision detection with slopes to make the height transition smoothly. The team continue the trend in Time Commando (TimeCo) and used pre-rendered backgrounds with video motion. A similar technique used in LBA movies but improved to be used not only as cut-scenes but in-game backgrounds with depth information attached and other scene information. TimeCo had another enhancement by adding texture mapping to their 3d model formats, feature then used in LBA2. ",
